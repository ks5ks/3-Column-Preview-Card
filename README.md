## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I spent a lot of time adjusting font size and padding to match the design. Using relative positioning for the problems might have eleminated that issue.

### Continued development

I plan to continue doing these types of challenges since I know that they are improving my understanding of HTML and CSS.
